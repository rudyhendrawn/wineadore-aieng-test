### Why this dataset?
This dataset contains user behavior data from an e-commerce platform, including various features that can help predict whether a user is likely to make a purchase or not. It is similar to the business problem at Wine Adore, where we want to identify users who are likely to convert into consumers.

## Purpose of the project
- Simulate Customer Segmentation: Profile customer segments based on their behavior.
- Simulate "Users->Consumers" Conversion: Identify patterns and features that differentiate users who make purchases from those who do not.
